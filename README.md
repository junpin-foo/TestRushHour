# TestRushHour
This is made to test out the Rush Hour Solver Code. This app specificically initiates a set board and runs the solver to test if the Rush Hour Solver has found the solution or not by checking if X is at the right edge of the board.

Example board:

AA...O\
P..Q.O\
PXXQ.O\
P..Q..\
B...CC\
B.RRR.
